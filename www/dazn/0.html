    <h1>DAZN</h1>
    <p>
        <b>DAZN</b> (/dəˈzoʊn/; pronounced "da zone") is a British over-the-top sports
        streaming and entertainment platform. Founded in 2007 as Perform Group
        via the merger of Premium TV Limited and Inform Group, it is owned by Access
        Industries, the investment group founded by Sir Len Blavatnik, and is
        headquartered in London, England. Shay Segev is DAZN's CEO as of January
        2021. The non-executive directors are Lincoln Benet, John Gleasure and
        Guillaume D’Hauteville. The DAZN platform was founded in 2015 and
        broadcasts live and on-demand sport in over 200 countries worldwide with a
        strong domestic presence in Italy, Spain, Germany, Japan, France, Portugal,
        Belgium, Taiwan, the United States and Canada, where it has key domestic
        broadcast rights. It is considered to be Europe's largest digital sports
        broadcaster with over 75 programming rights. As of 2023, the
        service has 20 million paid subscribers globally.

    <h4>Streaming Technology and Infrastructure</h4>
    <p>DAZN operates on a foundation of Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (<b>DASH</b>), which is more than just a
        network protocol; it represents a paradigm for linking multimedia resources—specifically video and audio—with
        the temporal context of their delivery. DASH is designed to enhance the user experience by optimizing video
        playback quality through dynamic bitrate adjustments, responding to varying network conditions and device
        capabilities. Research has shown that DASH has become a leading standard in over-the-top (OTT) streaming due to
        its capability to adapt efficiently to fluctuating network environments, minimizing buffering and ensuring a
        seamless viewing experience (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9774530" target="_blank">Chen et al.,
            2022</a>). The methodology of DASH involves segmenting video content into smaller parts, each encoded at
        multiple bitrates, enabling the client to select the highest quality stream available without interruptions.
        This approach is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and optimizing network performance in the delivery of
        live and on-demand content (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3587745" target="_blank">Park et al.,
            2023</a>).</p>
    </p>
    <p>To deliver content efficiently, DAZN relies on a robust network of Content Delivery Network (CDN)
        infrastructures. In Italy, DAZN partners with leading CDN providers, including Akamai, Amazon CloudFront,
        Fastly, and Video Streaming. This multi-CDN strategy allows DAZN to leverage the strengths of each provider,
        ensuring that users are connected to the nearest server based on their geographic location. This deployment
        minimizes latency and enhances overall streaming performance, resulting in a smoother viewing experience for
        customers throughout the country.</p>

    <p>The localization of servers used for multimedia content distribution is pivotal in shaping the domain naming
        conventions of these servers. Each CDN provider, such as Akamai or Amazon CloudFront, adopts distinct naming
        practices. For example, servers managed by Akamai typically include specific keywords associated with the
        provider in their domains, such as <code>*livedazn.akamaized.net</code>, in case of Amakai.
        Similarly, Amazon CloudFront servers may exhibit different naming characteristics, as seen in
        <code>*ac-cdn.live.indazn.com</code>. More over, for all the HTTP servers observed in the Video Streaming
        infrastructure, the naming <code>*livedazn.daznedge.net</code> has been observed to be fairly frequent.
